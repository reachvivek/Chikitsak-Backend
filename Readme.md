<h1 align="center">About</H1>

Chikitsak has been made to scale up the existing telemedicine for doctors network and patient's welfare monitoring with key focus on rural/remote areas by using Azure that allows two way communication and is not dependant on Internet Service Providers. All data is to be held in a cloud serverless architecture, Integrating cloud tech with Patient MIS and Aadhaar authentication, in order to make it easy for patients belonging to low socio economic and educational backgrounds for safe keeping of medical records and also for accessing the databases by emergency medical technicians by merely using biometric / thumb impressions.
